# Sorting_algorithms

## A project that shows Selection-sort and merge-sort algorithms, also involving multithreading to sort big files faster

This project is an example of how various sorting algorithms work. These methods work on lists of strings. 
The selection-sorting algorithm also contains a binary search function, which can show at what index of the sorted list is the 
string in question.
The merge-sorting algorithm goes along with multithreading, the given list is parted into n groups, and each of them is sorted 
simultaneously. After that, the groups are merged together using a merge-sorting algorithm, and the result is printed into a new file.
